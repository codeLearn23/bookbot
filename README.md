# bookbot


BookBot is a [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project. The end result is a Python based program that takes the text of a book, such as Frankenstein, from the Project Gutenberg online library, and delivers a report on the total number of words in the book, as well as a breakdown of the total counts of each alphabetical character. On completion of the project a student will have put together a local Python dev environment, deployed the project to their GitHub account, and gained basic familiarity with VS Code.
